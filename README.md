# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

Repo provides various exploratory analysis on the dataset to get insight on data. As an example, I have taken the Titanic dataset from Kaggle ([Titanic DataSet] )

The code is generalized for other dataset also. You can use the script for other dataset with minimal changes.


## Usage



## Output Content

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
